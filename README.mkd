# All-o-stasis

["Allostasis is essential in order to maintain internal viability amid
changing conditions"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allostasis)

All-o-stasis is a very simple web interface for route setters and visitors of the
Minimum boulder gym. The framework tracks all currently available (and history
of removed) boulders. Additionally, admins can survey the performance of their
setters.

Visitors can rate boulders (1 - 3 stars).

The project is based on nodejs, express, jade and uses mongodb.

**NOTE** The code is quite hacky in some places! I hope to find time for a
major cleanup in the near future.


## Quick start ##

In order to run the boulder admin install the following dependencies:

* [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) v0.6.6 or higher
* [npm](http://npmjs.org/) v1.1.0 or higher
* [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/) v2.0 or higher

Using npm the rest of the dependencies can be installed:

    npm install

To start the server

    mkdir db (only do that once)
    mongod --dbpath db &
    node_modules/coffee-script/bin/coffee server.coffee
    open localhost:3000 in browser



## Using all-o-stasis in your gym?

Currently the code probably needs quiet some tweaking to work for your gym. In
the (not so near) future I plan to implement a more modular approach abstracting
common features of climbing gyms. Until then you most probably have to change
the database layout and code concerning grades.

If you need further assistance feel free to email me.
